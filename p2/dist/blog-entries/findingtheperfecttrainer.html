<h1>Finding the Perfect Trainer</h1>
<p>I have been building and running training departments for around 10 years. It certainly is not as long as some, but it is enough time to see what works and what does not work. Over the course of my career to date, I have interviewed and hired a number of trainers. Some I was certain were going to be good, and some, though I hate to admit it, <em>I hired out of desperation to get a warm body into the slot</em>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Hiring out of desperation is never good!</strong></span></h3>
<p>I know that we all do it. The weight of the work is heavy, and with no end in sight, it seems like there is no way that it will ever get done. The customer will be mad. Your boss will be mad. The department will never grow. You find someone who meets some of the requirements, but not all. You convince yourself you can make the new hire fit the mold and the needs. So you do it. You hire the person who is O-K but not good.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Don’t do it!</strong></span></h3>
<p>Hiring out of desperation always results in heart break. The employee never meets your expectations, or those of the higher ups. While the theory is always that the employee can be trained to follow your ways and molded to meet expectations, <em>there was a reason why you felt it was a desperation hire</em>, and that is because the basic requirements were missing that would allow for the training and molding to occur.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>So what are those requirements?</strong></span></h3>
<p>During my tenure, there a few things that I have noticed make a good trainer, and they might surprise you. Here they are in order of importance – to me.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Have to love it!</strong> – Some subject-matter experts (SME) are forced into training, but just because you know how to do something doesn’t mean that you are good at teaching it. There is a need to love teaching, first and foremost. Loving teaching doesn’t mean you are good at it, but it usually means that you are enthusiastic. <em>Enthusiasm helps retain the learners’ attention.</em> If a trainer does not display enthusiasm, the learners will be lost from the start, and then it doesn’t matter how good the training is or how well the trainer communicates, the learners will not retain the information, and they will leave with a sour taste in their mouths.I am the oldest of three, and when I was younger, and my sisters were really young, I babysat them for the summer. I made them play school. Sure they wanted to play office, house, or anything else, but I was the oldest, and school was my choice. I created lesson plans, had homework and tests – the whole nine yards. They hated it (it was summer break after all). I loved it. That was when I knew I wanted to teach. You have to love it. Teaching/Training has to be your passion to really be good – striving for great. Side note: I rewarded them by getting Wendy’s and McDonald’s to deliver. So I wasn’t all evil!</li>
	<li><strong>Drive comes from the success of others</strong> – It does not hurt to be intrinsically driven. In fact, that can really help. Having pride in your work and getting your satisfaction from knowing you did a job well done is important. However, I strongly believe that with teaching, it is important that drive is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>not</em></span> derived from external praise. <em>Getting drive and a feeling of success from seeing others succeed results in the best trainers.</em>Think about teachers in inner city schools. They know they are up against a battle, and they are not after accolades. They are looking to see one student – sometimes just one – defy the odds and succeed. When a student succeeds – gets that ‘A’ for the first time, goes to college when no one else in the family has, decides to walk away rather than fight – that is when the teacher that helped that student reach that goal, the teacher who gave that student the tools to make the right decision, feels successful.
		<p>Corporate training is the same – in the success factor. The challenges are often not as great, and the failure not as devastating, but the success can be just as strong. When a student gets it, applies what was learned, and then succeeds, it is an amazing feeling. Seeing employees turn failure into success, get promoted, or even just become better at their jobs based on the tutelage you have given them feels great – or at least it should. We all hear trainers say that they feel the best when a student has an “ah-ha” moment in training, but it is more than that. It is seeing something that was causing problems or frustrating now being something that is causing the student to feel good. It is knowing that what you have taught them they have been able to apply to be better. Having that as the drive that defines you as a trainer really makes a difference. <em>Students want to learn from someone who wants to teach them and who they can sense really cares.</em> It makes training more bearable because, let’s be honest, there are many classes that employees have to sit through that hold little to no interest for them, but knowing that the person teaching them really cares about them gets them involved and engaged.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Have a thirst for knowledge</strong> – This may seem like it is a given, but it really isn’t. When you have those SMEs who know a lot about what they are teaching, they don’t necessarily care about evolving, learning new things, or learning different ways. Evolving may include learning more about what is being taught – there are new advances every day – or more about how to teach it. It may also be to simply learn, even things that are not directly related.It is imperative that a trainer is constantly learning. If a trainer is stagnant, it is likely that the individuals being trained will actually lap the trainer and will become disinterested in training. Worse yet, the trainer will lose credibility with the students. It is hard to gain back that credibility once lost.
		<p>Learning does not always equate to education. I have two Master’s degrees, a number of certificates, and I still take classes to learn new things, but that is not the only way to learn. Learners can read, go to the library, test limits, and many more things to learn new things. Find out how the trainer likes to learn and stays on top of things. Look for that thirst. When I am interviewing, I don’t always require a degree. I have met many people how are great trainers and even better employees, but don’t have degrees. They are self-learners, and they have gained years of experience. <em>Experience and a drive to learn always beats a degree</em> – unless a degree is absolutely required (regulatory requirement, anyone?).</p>
		<p>Learning things that are not directly related to the topics for which the trainer was originally hired shows initiative and a thirst for knowledge. Being a self-learner and someone who wants to be the best at what they do shows drive. As the trainer learns, the new knowledge makes them a greater asset to the organization, as well as helps the trainer advance both personally and professionally. It enhances the trainer’s ability to answer questions that may arise and often increases training skills. Additionally, honing skills as a trainer in order to learn the latest training tactics and about the newest tools will help the trainer create engaging, creative trainings that meet the needs of a wider audience. That requires a constant learning and evolving process – however that process might take place.</p>
		<p>So identifying that the trainer really does have a thirst for knowledge, growth, and challenges will help you identify a trainer who will flourish. When a trainer grows, the trainer is more likely going to stay with the organization longer as well. So now the effort you have put into molding and mentoring that individual will benefit the organization.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Strong communication skills</strong> – Duh! I don’t even know why I am including this. If a trainer does not have strong written and verbal communication skills, failure is certain. A trainer really does need to understand how to communicate effectively and concisely (not always my strong suit there). Information should be disseminated in a variety of fashions, so written communication is just as important as verbal communication. It goes right back to that credibility situation. If a trainer cannot communicate via email and other forms of written communication, credibility goes down. Employees need to feel as engaged and trust their trainers’ expertise just as much when they are back at their desks reading materials, cheat sheets, and emails as they do in class. Trainers need to know how to communicate non-verbally as well. They need to be able to read and adapt to non-verbal cues from their audience, and they need to be aware of how they are communicating non-verbally. It is important they understand communication resources (e.g., PowerPoint, video), as well, because those will be very important for that self-learning that takes place outside the classroom.</li>
	<li><strong>Have energy</strong> – This goes right back to loving training. However, it warrants its own point because loving what you do doesn’t make you good at it. We need to have all the other components to be the best. This includes having energy. Have you ever been in a class where you can see the teacher loves what is being taught and loves teaching it, but is just so boring that you cannot focus or stay engaged? It is the worst!Having energy, personality, and keeping people awake in whatever way comes natural – and is still appropriate – is important. This includes being enthusiastic, finding tacticals that keep the students moving (even if with just their hands), making sure exercises are included during the training, even when that seems like a hard task, and conducting the training with energy. Keep it lively. Make (appropriate) jokes if you can and that’s natural. I embrace my inner dork (really, it isn’t that far inner). It works. Have energy because that energy is contagious, and it will keep others engaged. So look for this energy in your trainers.</li>
	<li><strong>Be creative <em>(in some way)</em></strong> – Creativity is often thought of as only artistic expressions, but that isn’t really true. Creativity comes out in a variety of ways. Thank goodness because if creativity was only art, I would have none – unless you count writing, and that is pretty subjective. Creativity could be expressed by uniquely approaching a situation, challenge, or dilemma and coming up with an out-of-the-box solution. It could be finding a way to turn a standard PowerPoint into something fun using the basic tools within the PowerPoint program. The most important part of creativity with regard to trainers is how they can keep training fresh and different. Teaching hasn’t changed much in the last 100 years. Sure, now there are computers and PowerPoints can be included. We can watch videos to teach us how to do something, but all-in-all, it really just hasn’t changed significantly. Finding ways to utilize multiple mediums and tailor training to meet the needs of a large number of learners is hard to do sometimes, but a creative person will find a way. Creative people have brought us PowerPoint for use in training, video tutorials, Learning Management Systems (LMS), and more. Now, trainers need to use those tools or develop new ones to keep the engagement high.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #666699;"><strong>So, what’s the long and short of it <em>(or as my nerdier friends would say, tl;dr;)</em>?</strong></span></p>
<p>Don’t hire out of desperation. Look for a trainer who is or at least has the potential to be great. Look for the characteristics that make a great trainer, including loving it, being driven by the success of others, having a thirst for knowledge, having strong communication skills, energy, and being creative. That’s the one you’ll love molding and mentoring, and that’s the one that will bring increased success to your organization. Sure, it also helps if they know about what they are going to teach, but in many cases, they can learn. So while that helps, it isn’t the most important.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Now, go forth.<br />Be awesome.<br />Find those amazing trainers because they are out there!</strong></p>
