## Outside resources
- Used Templated Captive Green as design template started but heavily edited: <https://all-free-download.com/free-website-templates/download/captivegreen_2534.html>
- Used W3Schools how-to to include HTML content from external source: <https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_html_include.asp>
-- Note that finding the proper placement took some time, and only absolute URLs would resolve, despite root-relative being expected to work.
- W3Schools for some basic form styling: <https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_form.asp>
