    <p data-test="about-content">I'm a teacher, observer of human behavior, talker, nerd, and so much more. I'm trying to survive parenthood, work, and school - not always successfully. I know a lot about little and a little about a lot. I'm just here to express myself, my observations, and the things I have learned along the way. You'll learn more about me by reading my ramblings.</p>
