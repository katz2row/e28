<p>For many years, I have volunteered for an important and wonderful organization called <strong><a href="http://www.ourhouseofhope.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Our Community House of Hope (OCHH)</a></strong>. Their vision is simple - all who are facing the end of life may die with dignity, comfort and peace.</p>
<p><strong>OCHH</strong> is <em>100% community-funded</em>, and almost entirely supported by volunteers. They survive based on support of those who care and believe in the mission. Yet they struggle, as many charities do, especially during the summer.</p>

<p>I believe that <strong>OCHH</strong> is further hindered by our own fears of mortality. We all want to die with dignity, comfort, peace, and love, but we don’t want to think about it. Supporting a charity such as <strong>OCHH</strong> forces us to consider what it would be like for us.</p>
<p>I’ve lost some close family members – my stepmom and aunt – within the last 6 months. Just over a year prior to my stepmom’s passing, her mother passed away at <strong>Our Community House of Hope</strong>. After years of trying to figure out how I could support them, they supported me and my family. They offered us something we needed more than words can express, and their continued support and love has been overwhelming. So I understand first-hand the immense importance of what they do. I’ve felt my heart lighten due to their care, and I wish I could do more than I do to support them.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><strong>They do what so many others shy away from doing – and they do it beautifully.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>OCHH</strong> offers a cozy home for those who are at their end of life. Many families cannot act as caregivers to their loved ones, and some people are entirely alone. <strong>OCHH</strong> provides them a place to be loved and cared for in their last days. <strong>OCHH</strong> does not receive insurance reimbursements or government funding - relying only on donations from the community, from people like you and me. The resident need only be on medical hospice to qualify.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><strong>It costs approximately $245 for resident per day. A typical stay is 15 days, which is $3,675.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>OCHH receives calls every day from people who need their services.</p>

<p>Currently <strong>OCHH</strong> is celebrating summertime with their Summertime Memories pinwheels. I’ve purchased three in memory of my stepmom, aunt, and step-grandma. The pinwheels line the yards.

It was like Darla was telling me, "Hello."
