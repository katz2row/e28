# Project 1

## Outside resources
- I knew I could use v-bind:class, but I could not remember if I could use that for src as well. I verified this would work on <https://dev.to/seifsay3d/adding-dynamic-html-attributes-with-vuejs-ljb>. I found it in the Notes after.
- To see the proper syntax for adding multiple functions (not really what I needed but a starting place), I checked here: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38744932/how-to-call-multiple-functions-with-click-in-vue. I ended up realizing I could just pass the value in the function call and therefore didn't need onClick to do two things.

## Notes for instructor
- The images were downloaded and edited for Week 2's project. They were downloaded from royalty free sites, and I did not take note of which sites I used for which pictures.
- I primarily completed this assignment by reviewing and re-reviewing the Notes and videos and A LOT of trial and error.
- I probably spent too much time trying to get the smallest things working right, such as dynamically showing the word "to."
